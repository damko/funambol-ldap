For testing this connector and its classess you need at least
two ldap server with the following data
1- ldap://ldap.example.com 
the standard ldap server where to store users with inetOrgPerson objectClass
users may have the following attribute where to store 
the ldapuri of the addressbook: psRoot

the test ldap tree is the following:
uid=aaccf.amar,ou=people,dc=bigdomain.net,o=bigcompany,dc=babel,dc=it


2- ldap://pab.example.com/
ldap server where to store addressbook

the test ldap tree is:
ldap://pab.example.com/ou=rpolli@bigdomain.net,dc=bigdomain.net,ou=PAB

= Officer =
The ldap officer authenticate users in the standard 2way move:
- bind with credentials defined in officer xml and search for matching field
aka. ldapsearch -D admin -wadmin -b "dc=babel,dc=it" "(mail=aacf.amar@bigdomain.net)" dn 
- bind with the DN returned by the previous search
aka ldapsearch -D "thepreviousdn" -wpassword "(objectclass=*)" dn mail givenName sn psRoot

- return an LDAPUser object, which extends the Sync4jUser 
providing the info retrieved from ldap (eg. the DN, the mail,..)
