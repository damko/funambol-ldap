 Funambol Ldap Connector
=========================

Funambol ldap connector allows you to synchronize 
your personal addressbook with an ldap tree.

The ldap tree is configurable and may be fixed
or dynamic: 
 * using a substring of the authenticated username;
 * pointing to a tree specified in an ldap attribute of the user (if you're using ldap authentication).


See INSTALL.txt for more infos.
